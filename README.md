# SCMB-Modeling-Accelerator-Project: Bees Knees: An Agent-Based Model of Varroa Mite Infestation of Bee Hives
This repository contains all NetLogo files that my group worked on over Summer 2021. 
It is a agent-based modeling program that simulates the relationship between worker bees and varroa mites.

**Project Synopsis:**
The agent-based model implemented with NetLogo attempts to accurately model the relationship and interactions between varroa mites and honey bees. Varroa mites introduced to beehives transmit diseases such as the Deformed Wing Virus (DWV) to bee larvae, and as the mites populate exponentially the overall bee population becomes increasingly affected by the DWV. Essential oil treatments (ex. thyme and spearmint) were introduced to the model to test how reapplication times of oils can affect virus transmission and total varroa mite count within an arbitrary span of time. Further refinement of the model could help beekeepers predict an essential oil cocktail that would be the most effective against varroa mite infestation.

This project was worked on by Lis Dautaj, Tatiana Bolds, Carissa Wu, and Elijah Chou for the Southeast Center for Mathematics and Biology's Summer Modeling Accelerator
Program 2021. Our mentor Ryan Rinaudo was exceptionally helpful in our learning and creation process.
