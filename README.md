# SCMB-Modeling-Accelerator-Project: Bees Knees: An Agent-Based Model of Varroa Mite Infestation of Bee Hives
This repository contains all NetLogo files that my group worked on over Summer 2021. 
It is a agent-based modeling program that simulates the relationship between worker bees and varroa mites.

This project was worked on by Lis Dautaj, Tatiana Bolds, Carissa Wu, and Elijah Chou for the Southeast Center for Mathematics and Biology's Summer Modeling Accelerator
Program 2021. Our mentor Ryan Rinaudo was exceptionally helpful in our learning and creation process.
